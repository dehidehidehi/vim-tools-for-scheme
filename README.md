# Vim tools for Scheme

The developper experience for Scheme using vanilla Vim is painful.  
The goal of this repository is to provide a modern developper experience in Vim for making RNRS compliant Scheme applications.  
Specifically R6RS.  

# Solutions 

This repository aims to provide a good developper experience for Scheme:
- reasonable Vim settings tailored to Scheme.
- support for easy procedure discoverability, find what you need without leaving Vim.
- support for documentation pop-ups from within Vim.
- sane and overridable LSP configuration defaults for Scheme.
- a modern LSP experience combining the Racket LSP and the (in development) ChezScheme LSP.
- a remap for the ']' key to automatically close parenthesis or brackets.
- sane and overridable REPL defaults with library path detection using Akku.

## Also included

### A better Netrw

This opiniated package also provides settings and extra (more convenient) remappings for Netrw, the file system tray for Vim.   
Netrw keyboard mappings may seem unintuitive.  
You may refer to this great article for documentation on the remappings : [Using Netrw, the Vim built-in file explorer](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/using-netrw-vim-builtin-file-explorer/)  

These will be something you may disable in an upcoming release.  

Some examples of provided remaps :  
- normal mode:   `<C-n>`       -> Open Netrw
- netrw:        `ff`        -> create new file in current dir
- netrw:        `FF`        -> delete file under cursor
- netrw:        `dd`        -> create new dir in current dir
- netrw:        `DD`        -> delete dir under cursor

# Motivation

Setting up a developping environment for Scheme requires many days of configuration for the developper who just wants to make a program.  

Examples of such overhead include:  
- The little tooling which may exist is difficult to discover.
- The tooling which exists requires far too much time to configure.
- Some tooling is specific to the Scheme language.
- Some tooling is specific to the RNRS standard used.
- ... and last but not least, the developper is forced to develop their own tooling which are usually provided in other more popular languages, which may be demoralizing.

# Installation

## 1. Dependencies 

1. Compile and install with the [Vim compilation script](scripts/vim-compile.sh)
1. Execute the [Akku scheme package manager installation script](scripts/install-akku.sh)

## 2. Optional : testing

To try this configuration before incorporating it in your vimrc, you may execute the following command which will only load configurations from this package :  

### Vanilla

```zsh
echo '#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))
(display "Hello, world!")' > /tmp/testing-vim-tools-for-scheme/testing-scheme.sps
vim -u lib/vim-tools-for-scheme.vim /tmp/testing-vim-tools-for-scheme/test-scheme.sps
```

This should open a vim buffer with a Scheme `Hello world` program.  
Try using the `<leader>l` remap to execute the program in a REPL buffer :)  
You should be prompted to install the Racket LSP.  
You should be able to see syntax highlighting provided by the LSP.

### Or with the Akku package manager

```zsh
akku init /tmp/testing-vim-tools-for-scheme
echo '#!r6rs
(import (rnrs))
(display "Hello, world!")' > /tmp/testing-vim-tools-for-scheme/testing-scheme.sps
vim -u lib/vim-tools-for-scheme.vim /tmp/testing-vim-tools-for-scheme/testing-scheme.sps
```

This should open a vim buffer with a Scheme `Hello world` program.  
This also happens to load the buffer with a Scheme library path, managed by Akku.  
You should be prompted to install the Racket LSP.  
You should be able to see syntax highlighting provided by the LSP.

Try using the `<leader>l` remap to execute the program in a REPL buffer :)  
Try installing a package using the shell command `akku install <package>`, adding the `import` in the file, then executing it using `<leader>l` in the REPL; the REPL should be able to execute the Scheme source file and import the library.

# Usage

## Installation

### Adding the vim configuration

1. Copy [vim-tools-for-scheme.vim](lib/vim-tools-for-scheme.vim) to some place on your disk.
1. In your `.vimrc` add `source LOCATION_OF_VIM_TOOLS_FOR_SCHEME`
1. Re-source your `.vimrc`

## Default Keybindings

All default mappings are rebindable using, for example:  
```vim
au FileType scheme,racket nnoremap <leader>a	:LspCodeAction<CR>        
```

### Normal mode default keybindings

- `VtfsReplLoad`                -> `<leader>l`  
   Opens your Scheme REPL and evaluates the contents of the buffer into the REPL.
- `Open Netrw (:Ex)`            -> `<C-n>`
   Opens the file tray (Netrw) at the project root.

### Insert mode default keybindings

- `VtfsFindMatchingParenType`   -> `]`  
   Automatically closes a statement with the proper closing bracket, parenthesis, etc.  
- `<C-\>`                       -> `Î»`  
  Shortcut for inserting the lambda symbol.


### Normal mode LSP default keybindings

- `VtfsLspToggleDiagnostics`    -> `<leader>W`  
  Hides/Unhides the LSP diagnostics which may hinder code readability.

The documentation for the LSP supported commands is available in the [vim-lsp repository](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-commands).  

- `LspCodeAction`                 -> `<leader>a`
- `LspDefinition`                 -> `<leader>D`
- `LspHover`                      -> `<leader>k`
- `LspNextDiagnostic`             -> `<leader>n`
- `LspNextError`                  -> `<leader>e`
- `LspPeekDefinition`             -> `<leader>d`
- `LspPreviousDiagnostic`         -> `<leader>p`
- `LspPreviousError`              -> `<leader>E`
- `LspReferences`                 -> `<leader>b`
- `LspRename`                     -> `<leader>r`
